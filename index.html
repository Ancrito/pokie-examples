                <ul>
                    <li>Winning lines are counted from right to left. A line of minimum 3 winning symbols pays out.</li>
                    <li>"Wild" is a wild symbol that substitutes any other symbol on a winning line.</li>
                    <li>
                        "Scatter1" is a scatter symbol that pays out 10x, 20x, or 30x the bet if 3 or more symbols
                        appear on any positions. Only one "Scatter1" can appear on any reel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Scatter2" is a stacked scatter symbol that can appear on the 3 middle reels. If all 3 middle
                        reels are covered with "Scatter2" symbols, the game pays 100x the bet.

                <h2>Video slot with free spins</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">An example of a 5x3 video slot game with free spins.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Features:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>A minimum of 2 winning symbols on a winning line or scattered across all reels pays out.</li>
                    <li>
                        During free spins, symbols on a winning line are counted not only from left to right but can
                        also be scattered across the winning line definition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During free spins, symbol sequences are different from the base game's ones. Sequences during
                        free spins do not contain scatter symbols, so free spins cannot be re-triggered.
                    </li>
                    <li>During free spins, all wins are multiplied by x2.</li>
                    <li>This example also demonstrates the usage of Simulation to obtain the desired game outcomes.</li>
